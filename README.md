This is My first README. all I can tell is this is a Backend Project about Rent Book using Golang with Gorm and Echo Framework.
There's a jwt token for login authentication. and if user already have an account, user can just login with email and password.
User can edit or delete their data. 
User can rent the other user's book.
So every user have one book that can be rent to another user.
That's all I've got for this ReadME;)
